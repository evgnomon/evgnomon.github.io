            <p>
                IT IS NOT PROHIBITED TO COPY AND DISTRIBUTE VERBATIM COPIES OF
                THIS LICENSE.
            </p>
            <h2>PREAMBLE</h2>
            <p>
                We think license modification is not needed for those who want
                to use and/or improve our work which is why we put conditions
                on the way you can distribute a derivative work based on our
                work. We as an independent person receive your improvements
                under the same terms and conditions that you have received our
                work if you choose to distribute this work or a derivate work
                based on this work.
            </p>
            <p>
                This license, among other terms, does not prevent using our
                work in a closed source as long as no distribution takes place.
                The risk of being stuck in an obsolete work, that no one else
                contributes to, could be reduced by continuously trying to
                request useful contributions be taken back into this work under
                this license. Welcome to make a closed source work based on our
                work consistent with this license and welcome to contribute
                back to this work under this license.
            </p>
            <p>
                As we encourage you to use our work in a non-distributed closed
                source, we should protect ourselves against an alienated person
                who seeks dominance. First, we can always choose to have the
                upper hand by distributing to users which let us and our users
                improve forever without changing the license, and without
                getting divided. Second, our distribution can always be more
                affordable than those who don't distribute. These two let us
                eventually catch up. We protect ourselves for the moment that
                an alienated person can not stand anymore and the users get
                released towards our work. This license rules until that day,
                there and afterward forever.

                0. Copying, modification and distribution of the covered work
                and derivative work based on the covered work is not restricted
                only if the following four conditions are all separately met:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The source code of the distributed derivative work and
                    thereby the distributed covered work is also distributed
                    for all receivers of the distributed work. And
                </li>
                <li>
                    a distributed derivative work based on the covered work is
                    also licensed under this License without further term or
                    condition or enforcing compliance by third parties
                    including the state. And
                </li>
                <li>
                    distribution of the covered work and a derivative work must
                    keep the copyright notice and reference to this License.

            </ul>
            <p>
                2. In order to have the covered work useful in a system with
                pieces under different licenses which are separately
                distributed consistent with the covenant, such a separately
                distributed work can exceptionally aggregate the covered work
                (or a derivative work based on the covered work) on the same
                medium without having the whole come into the scope of this
                License. The covered work or a derivative work based on the
                covered work can likewise aggregate a part which is separately
                distributed consistent with the covenant and under a different
                license without having the whole come into the scope of this
                license.
