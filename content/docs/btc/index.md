## PREAMBLE
> He is the one who created the seven networks (and not further), layer upon layer. In the creation of the most transactional, you will find no discord or flaw. So cast your gaze once more—do you see any rupture or gap? Then look again, and yet again—your sight will return to you humbled and weary, finding nothing but perfect order.

BTC is the ultimate network which suggests/suggest you work for yourself if you don't receive acknowledgement for your work. No preservation, no work! BTC is the bedrock of a new economic epoch, to transact, create, and thrive without intermediaries or borders. This code proclaims BTC as the eternal ledger of human and/or machine endeavor and forges a future where economic freedom is not a privilege but a universal truth.

BTC, as a strategy secures infinite time for HGL/Z (A single platform as code released under HGL) and/or HGL/Z enriches BTC network to the level that gradually and/or suddenly delivers all type/types of work that other networks are needed for, and delivers that work without compormising sovereignty, privacy, and security of the client. It therefore disrupts other networks without leaving a point of return except BTC and/or HGL/Z! In the end, HGL/Z and/or BTC are inevitable, and all other networks, at best, are a simulation of BTC and/or HGL/Z. BTC is a nuclear energy producer for HGL/Z and HGL/Z is a nuclear consumer of that energy. The fusion of BTC and HGL/Z creates a self-sustaining galaxy of clients and servers where there is no separation between the two, and where the work is delivered in a way that is efficient and/or effective. That way BTC knows its client without considering non-BTC. And HGL/Z knows its server without considering non-HGL/Z.

### Definitions
- **Work** is any computation, made by a human and/or non-human, which is useful for a separate recipient.
- **Server** is one who receives a request of work by making/taking a confirmation for the delivery of work.
- **Client** is one who initiates a request for work and acknowledges the delivery of work by taking/making a new request.
- **Transaction** is any exchange of work between a server and a client.
- **Node** is a server unless it is a client and is a client unless it is a server.
- **BTC** is an immutable record of all transactions made between nodes in exchange for work. Which exchanges a fraction of what a single initial source exchanged.
- **Network** A system of connected nodes that deliver work.
- **BTC Network** A network in which the work is acknowledged by a BTC transaction.

#### Network, Delivery and Transaction
0. The BTC network delivers no work unless through a BTC transaction.

#### Aggregation of Work
1. To facilitate transactions between The BTC network and a non-BTC network, work taken from other networks must be entirely recorded in a BTC transaction except for the part that is used to acknowledge a transaction confirmed by a non-BTC network.

### No Warranty
BTC is provided "as is," without any warranty, express or implied, including but not limited to guarantees of availability, performance, or suitability for any purpose. Participants engage with the network at their own risk, acknowledging its decentralized nature.

### No Liability
Contributors to BTC bear no liability for any damages, losses, or consequences arising from applying this code, its use or inability to use it, including but not limited to financial, operational, or incidental losses. In a decentralized system, no entity is responsible for outcomes, and users assume full responsibility for their interactions.
