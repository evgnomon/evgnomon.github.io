**IT IS NOT PROHIBITED TO COPY AND DISTRIBUTE VERBATIM COPIES OF THIS LICENSE.**

### PREAMBLE

We believe there's no need to modify this license for those who wish to use and or enhance our work or a derivative work based on our work. Therefore, we've established specific guidelines for distributing any derivative works based on our original work. If you distribute your improvements or derivative works, they must be under the same terms that you received our original work.

We also encourage you for contributions back into our work to avoid reliance on your outdated material. As we think there would be only one main branch of code in long term which we all branch out from.

This license aslo encourages you to use our work in closed-source projects or software as a service or any other mechanism which is more effective to protect your work as long as you don't distribute our work (or derivative work based on our work). Such works has to be only licensed under terms and conditions of this license for distributing.

By protecting distribution of our work under the same license, we maintain two advantages along the way, allowing both us and our users to continually improve the work by making more derivative works in short term to maximize utility of our work. And our distribution model is designed to be more cost-effective in long term than non-distribution to establish unique identity for our work. This license protects us as a single body against being devided when time arrives putting this two together which let us overcome competitors under the same terms as we started with.

Copyright holders reserve all rights to protect the work and a derivative work covered by this License.

#### 0. Copying, modification and distribution

The covered work and derivative work based on the covered work is not restricted only if the following four conditions are all met:

1. The source code of the distributed derivative work and thereby the distributed covered work is also distributed for all receivers of the distributed work. And

2. A distributed derivative work based on the covered work is also licensed under this License without further term or condition or enforcing compliance by third parties including the state. And

3. Distribution of the covered work and a derivative work must keep the copyright notice and a verbatim copy of this License. And

4. The following disclaimer appropriately published in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.

#### 1. Aggregation of works

In order to have the covered work useful in a system with pieces under different licenses which are separately distributed consistent with the covenant, such a separately distributed work can exceptionally aggregate the covered work (or a derivative work based on the covered work) on the same medium without having the whole come into the scope of this License. The covered work or a derivative work based on the covered work can likewise aggregate a part which is separately distributed consistent with the covenant and under a different license without having the whole come into the scope of this license.
