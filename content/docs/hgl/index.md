*July 2022*

Copyright (C) 2022 evgnomon.org by Hamed Ghasemzadeh, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED

**IT IS NOT PROHIBITED TO COPY AND DISTRIBUTE VERBATIM COPIES OF THIS LICENSE.**

### PREAMBLE

We believe there's no need to modify this license for those who wish to use or enhance our work or a derivative work based on our work. Therefore, we've established specific guidelines for distributing any derivative works based on our original work. If you distribute your improvements or derivative works, they must be under the same terms that you received our original work.

This license allows you to use our work in a closed-source project, as long as you don't distribute it.
You're welcome to use our work for closed-source projects under this license and also your are welcome to contribute back to our original work under the same terms.
We encourage the incorporation of useful contributions back into our work to avoid reliance on your outdated material.

While encouraging the use of our work in a non-distributed, closed-source manner, we aim to protect against dominance by any single entity.
By distributing our work under the same license, we maintain an advantage, allowing both us and our users to continually improve the work.
And our distribution model is designed to be more cost-effective than non-distribution. These two helping us keep being accelerated by finding more contributors without being devided. 

Copyright holders reserve all rights to protect the work and a derivative work covered by this License.

#### 0. Copying, modification and distribution

The covered work and derivative work based on the covered work is not restricted only if the following four conditions are all separately met:

1. The source code of the distributed derivative work and thereby the distributed covered work is also distributed for all receivers of the distributed work. And

2. A distributed derivative work based on the covered work is also licensed under this License without further term or condition or enforcing compliance by third parties including the state. And

3. Distribution of the covered work and a derivative work must keep the copyright notice and reference to this License. And

4. The following disclaimer appropriately published in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.

#### 1. Aggregation of works

In order to have the covered work useful in a system with pieces under different licenses which are separately distributed consistent with the covenant, such a separately distributed work can exceptionally aggregate the covered work (or a derivative work based on the covered work) on the same medium without having the whole come into the scope of this License. The covered work or a derivative work based on the covered work can likewise aggregate a part which is separately distributed consistent with the covenant and under a different license without having the whole come into the scope of this license.

**EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING, THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE WORK "AS IS" WITHOUT IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY AND TITLE, AND ANY OTHER KIND OF EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES.**

**IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF GOODWILL, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS WORK OR AS A RESULT OF OUR LICENSE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.**

However, You may at your option offer support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License in exchange for a fee.
