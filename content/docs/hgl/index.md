## HGL GENERAL LICENSE

*July 2022*

Copyright (C) 2022 evgnomon.org by Hamed Ghasemzadeh, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED

**IT IS NOT PROHIBITED TO COPY AND DISTRIBUTE VERBATIM COPIES OF THIS LICENSE.**

### PREAMBLE

We maintain that there's no necessity to alter this license for those who intend to utilize, augment, or create derivative works from our original covered work. Consequently, we've set forth specific guidelines for the distribution of any such derivative works. Any distributed improvements or derivatives must adhere to the same licensing terms as our original work.

We encourage contributions to our original work, helping to prevent dependency on outdated versions. We anticipate a single primary code branch, from which all derivatives will emerge.

Our license permits the use of our work in "closed-source" projects, "software as a service", or other methods that effectively safeguard your work, provided you do not distribute a derivative work. Distribution must be exclusively licensed under the conditions of this license.

By ensuring our work is distributed under this uniform license, we gain two key benefits: it allows for continuous enhancement through derivative works, maximizing the utility of our original work in the short term, and our distribution approach proves more cost-efficient in the long run, establishing a distinct identity for our work. This license unifies us against fragmentation, enabling us to outperform competitors while adhering to our original terms.

Copyright holders reserve all rights to protect this work and a derivative work covered by this License.

#### 0. Copying, Modification and Distribution

The Covered Work is hereby granted the freedom of copying and modification without restriction. And any Derivative Work that is based on the Covered Work may also be distributed, provided that the Source Code of the Derivative Work is made available for free to all recipients and remains subject to the terms of this License, without the imposition of additional restrictions, terms, or conditions, and without effective enforcement obligations including patent enforcement imposed by third parties or state entities. Therefore, all copies, modifications, and distributions of the Covered Work must retain the original copyright notice and include an unaltered copy of this License.

#### 1. Aggregation

In instances where the Covered Work or its Derivative Work is integrated into a system comprising works governed by various licenses, it is permissible, as an exception, to aggregate the Covered Work or its Derivative Work on a single medium. In such cases, the entirety of the aggregated works on the medium does not need to be subjected to the terms of this License. This exception is designed to facilitate compatibility and usability within system(s) encompassing a diverse range of licensing agreements.

The following disclaimers must keep being prominently displayed in the documentation and any other materials for the Covered Work or a Derivative Work:

**EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING, THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE COVERED WORK "AS IS" WITHOUT IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY AND TITLE, AND ANY OTHER KIND OF EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES.**

**IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF GOODWILL, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE COVERED WORK OR AS A RESULT OF OUR LICENSE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.**

Nevertheless, you retain the option to extend offers of support, warranties, indemnities, or other liability obligations and/or rights in alignment with this License. Such offers may be provided in exchange for a fee, at your discretion. This provision allows you to engage in commercial transactions by offering additional services or assurances while remaining compliant with the terms of this License.
