## HGL GENERAL LICENSE

*July 2022*

Copyright (C) 2022 evgnomon.org by Hamed Ghasemzadeh, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED

**IT IS NOT PROHIBITED TO COPY AND DISTRIBUTE VERBATIM COPIES OF THIS LICENSE.**

### PREAMBLE

We maintain that there's no necessity to alter this license for those who intend to utilize, augment, or create derivative works from our original work. Consequently, we've set forth specific guidelines for the distribution of any such derivative works. Any distributed improvements or derivatives must adhere to the same licensing terms as our original work.

We encourage contributions to our original work, helping to prevent dependency on outdated versions. We anticipate a single primary code branch, from which all derivatives will emerge.

Our license permits the use of our work in closed-source projects, software as a service, or other methods that effectively safeguard your work, provided you do not distribute our work or its derivatives. Distribution must be exclusively licensed under the conditions of this license.

By ensuring our work is distributed under this uniform license, we gain two key benefits: it allows for continuous enhancement through derivative works, maximizing the utility of our original work in the short term, and our distribution approach proves more cost-efficient in the long run, establishing a distinct identity for our work. This license unifies us against fragmentation, enabling us to outperform competitors while adhering to our original terms.

Copyright holders reserve all rights to protect the work and a derivative work covered by this License.

#### 0. Copying, modification and distribution

Copying, modification and distribution of the covered work is not restricted only if the following two conditions are both met:

1. The source code of the distributed derivative work based on the covered work is also distributed for all receivers under this license without further restriction, term and condition or enforcing compliance by third parties including the state. And

2. Copying, modification and distribution of the covered work must keep the copyright notice and a verbatim copy of this license. The following disclaimers appropriately published in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.

#### 1. Aggregation of works

In order to have the covered work useful in a system with works under different licenses, a distribution can exceptionally aggregate the covered work on the same medium without having the whole covered under this license.

**EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING, THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE COVERED WORK "AS IS" WITHOUT IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY AND TITLE, AND ANY OTHER KIND OF EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES.**

**IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF GOODWILL, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE COVERED WORK OR AS A RESULT OF OUR LICENSE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.**

However, You may at your option offer support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this license in exchange for a fee.
