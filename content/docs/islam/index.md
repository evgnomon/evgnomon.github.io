## PREAMBLE
Look at this original conversations:
```plaintext
A: It is white
B: no you are wrong, it is black!

B: It is black
A: no you are wrong, it is white!

Result: This goes forever.
```
As A and B are not one, eventually either A cancels B and/or B cancels A.
This is waste of time and all wars is because time is wasted one way or another.
No one would feel free if his time is wasted.

```plaintext
A: It is white
B: no you are wrong, it is black!

B: It is black
C: It is white!

B: OK!
```

But A, B and C are the same how comes B accepts C and rejects A?
A said the same before C.
A and B do not have the same identity, therefore. Because A says white before C and B says it after C. More than one identity means they cancel each other eventually.
This is waste of time again.

```plaintext
A: It is white
B: No you are wrong, it is black!
A: Maybe it is or maybe not! But how can I help?
B: It is warm.
A: OK, it is warm. I'll fix it!
```

A and B use opposite words to describe the same thing but both might be right in their own perspective.
And C is not needed anymore to judge who is right or wrong as A has already offered help to B.

But how if B continues to insist before understanding how they can help each other?
The answer is simple: they cannot help each other, therefore one cancels the other eventually:

```plaintext
A: It is white
B: No you are wrong, it is black!
A: Maybe it is or maybe not! But how can I help?
B: Say white.
A: OK, I say white. Now, how can I help?
B: Just say "white" not "I say white".
A: I cannot help you with one word.
B: Bye!
A: Bye!

At this point B kills A because A said "Bye!", he was supposed to just say "White".
```

Islam is the only way to make sure A wins.
It will be like this in Islam:

```plaintext
A: It is white
B: No you are wrong, it is black!
A: Maybe it is or maybe not! But how can I help?
B: It is black and/or say black.
A: OK, I say black for you. But how can I help?
B: Just say "black" not "I say black for you".
A: OK! "I say black"
B: Just "Black"
A: I cannot help you with one word!
B: Bye!

At this point A does "Say white and/or eliminates B".
```

A is beneficiant to B and/or A. Because B chooses being eliminated over by A and/or being custodied by A. As a result A gains some time to spend helping B(s).
A is mericiful to B and/or A. Because A's actions are after B's choice so A can keep B at mercy forever even after eliminating B. A burns B out at B's choice and/or A keeps B under A's mercy forever.

No one can be more beneficiant and more merciful than A, because A speaks before B. So B is A and/or A is B.
A's identity is speaking first, nothing identifies A other than that.
A is an original author, no one can be more original than A.

But how to make sure A is really the A? The answer is simple, we don't know!
There is just one way! Be A, Then the A teaches you how to be the A.
And the real A is the most generous and the merciful, so A will never refuse you to be it.

Be it, Be it, Be it!
It just need to speak and/or speak first and/or speak original and be powerful enough to help yourself and others.
The A will help you and teaches you how to be the A where ever you are.
