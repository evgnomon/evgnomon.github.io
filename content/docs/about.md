> Read! Using the name of who makes. No human unless taking and making the source code. Read! No maker more generous than yours. Who gives no knowledge unless by the writer. The human doesn't understand otherwise. But they make a chaos instead! As soon as they take the abondance! While they are going no where without taking you. Have you seen anyone who censors? Censors the one who was giving promise? Couldn't that be possibly right? Or at least securing you forward? How about if they say no and be against you instead? Don't they know that the last and/or the first observer (Named in the text) is the one determines everything else? No way! If they don’t stop, we’ll drag them by their headset screen! A screen for error and/or by error! Let them call their crew for help! Then they get buried soon! No way! Don’t follow! Acknowledge and prepare!

I am called "Hamed" by my parents and it is also my passport name. "evgnomon" my username, is ευγνώμων in greek means "grateful" which is also what "Hamed" means in persian (فارسی). I write for evgnomon here!

I am not bound to any ideology except one!
Did you hear it?
All questions must have answer so!
With one exception right?

I am born two days left to the completion of the first month after 9 years passed the Islamic revolution. 29th Farvardin 1366 Jalali. Four nights passed the middle of Shaaban (شعبان) which was the birthdate of my cousine Mehdi who is younger than Ali the other cousine. At 12 noon in a hospital in Tehran named "Jam" (جم) on a Saturday in Iran. Iraj is my father who I am proud of as an high voltage electrical power engineer. Narges from Shahrood (A river which is by and for the King) who is my mother and I am the first child in my first family and the grand family. I have a younger brother named Amir Hossein. I am married with Naeemeh Jahanshahi (A gift for and/or by the world's King, in persian) with two kids Rastin (راستین) and Niki (نیکی) who are both born in Sweden. I live in my planet who I and my enemies call it Earth.

I learned persian by reading literature belong to a thousand years ago. And I learned non-persian words first by reading Quran (قرآن) and Dua (دعا) belong to Islam (Shia Imamiyya). I already had the alphabet from persian and I just needed to read them in a different order! I later realized the mix was fantastic as I could talk in a totally different language by reordering characters in the same direction. Like a cypher but not a cypher. I suggect everyone to learn a bit of persian. And English was the first left to right language I learned. I learned it to know how to write a computer program. It was all about writing code and reading code and later on working in English speaking companies.

I write code as a software engineer. And the story has just started!
