I am called "Hamed" by my parents and it is also my passport name. "evgnomon" my username, is ευγνώμων in greek means "grateful" which is also what "Hamed" means in persian (فارسی). I write for evgnomon here!

I am not bound to any ideology except one!
Did you hear it?
All questions must have answer so!
With one exception right?
