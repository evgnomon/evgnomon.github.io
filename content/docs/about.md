# About

I am not bound to any ideology except one! Did you hear it? Maybe, I hope so. All questions must have answer so! With one exception right? I don't see any other ideology unless that works for me. Would you need to? I don't need you if you don't work for me! Should I? Ah! OK, But! Should I need you if you don't need me? You have no standpoint except one! Do you see it? Time ticks forever! With an exception right?

This is what ChatGPT understood on the above passage
>"Overall, the passage seems to advocate for a philosophy that places high value on individual perspective, personal benefit, and a somewhat skeptical view of mutual or altruistic relationships. It challenges the reader to reflect on these viewpoints, possibly questioning their own beliefs and relationships in the process."

Do you agree?

I am called "Hamed" by my parents and the family and it is also my passport name. "evgnomon" is ευγνώμων in greek and pronounced ev̱gnó̱mo̱n means "grateful" which is also what "Hamed" means in persian (فارسی).

I write for evgnomon here! Makes sense?

I would like to hear you, so you can email your reflection to "hg -you know the sign- evgnomon.org". I hope we become a friend. That simple.
