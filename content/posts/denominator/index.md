![Denominator](denominator.webp)

Assume you give another party exposure to money. Basically, write it under a private key belonging to the second party. This is leverage as money is measured in non-money. As this is a leveraged contract for the first party, it must be a leveraged contract for the second one too. The contract just rolls forward as long as money is measured in non-money.

The ratio at which the first party is in leverage remains constant as long as earnings for the first party, out of the contract, are not written in non-money. So it remains constant and equal to the levered over time. However, the leverage ratio of the second party is the total amount of non-money denominated by money read in non-money which is always more than one.

As the leverage ratio of the party measuring in non-money is always higher than the party measuring in money, the second party gets buried in non-money. Burn. Any action to slow down would look like erasure one way or the other. Money increases the leverage of the contract in the denominator so effectively cancels erasure by keeping non-money levered back to the previous ratio or maybe higher. Fall in before you fall in. Just cry otherwise.

Two parties, counter parties being in a leveraged contract. One controls the rate of leverage for both. A denominator. Erasing the staff belongs to the dead body. A bust.
