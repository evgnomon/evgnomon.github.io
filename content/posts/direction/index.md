The dilemma is that we don't have enough time to reproduce everything needed outside the factory.
So we will have to use things from the inside while securing the exit.
What is important in this is to separate the specification from the implementation.
So we can plug another implementation when we exit the factory while securing things that are already independent.
We will have to live in two worlds at the same time, but we only have some reproducible elements outside the factory.

Things that are printable in space can come into existence on earth with unprintable parts.
This lets us use printable parts so we can continue building the entire system at an accelerated pace.
This is the fastest way forward and the most accurate way.

The question arises as to which part of the printable system we build next.
The answer would be the part that is first printable in space and that is very useful in combination with things that exist in the factory.

But among things that are useful and printable, which one should be the first?
The answer is everything that lets my first function run, without it knowing if it is on Earth or in space.
Which leads to the second printable function coming into existence, and so on.

As the functions have a lifecycle from the code editor of the developer to production, there shouldn't be anything from the beginning and along the way that the function is dependent on unless it is also available outside the factory. This way we can ensure the second function is printable using the first and in the same pipeline. This is also why the first function would be created by the one who lives in both worlds simultaneously.

If the entire pipeline and the next function is printable then, we should be able to assemble functions in local lab just like the first day we entirely terminate in the factory. At a certain time, the next function added to the system will replace the pipeline with a fully printable one when its time arrives.

As the current system and a printable one coexist, there must be a check to ensure the production is not toxic, i.e., it can decouple without needing to rebuild everything. There must be a gatekeeper. That is a single person. The singularity.
