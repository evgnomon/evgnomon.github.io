Selection is natural when it can be unnatural and it is unnatural when it can be natural.
If selection becomes too much natural, it continues accelerated until it ignites the first unnatural selection to the level that it doesn't come in relation with other selections unless leaving a reminder to repeat the process independently. The fuel to this process is the prior natural selection going on accelerated or it will never come to existence initially! While going accelerated fuels in the anti-natural selection process which on its own is the only real natural selection as there is nothing else existing in future.

The dark energy triggers entropy and entropy accelerates by contributing back to the dark energy and that acceleration goes to the level that the dark energy triggers the first trigger which reduces entropy. At that point the dark energy is a fuel not only to natural selection but also to an unnatural one. Entropy is a playing field of the dark energy and entropy is securing the future for the dark energy while entropy can also secure a future for a non-dark energy. Disregarding how small is the probability, and how much time has passed, this symmetry is not lasting so it is broken.

The broken symmetry is an extra dimmension orthogonal to any other dimmension. The observer can not see the extra dimmension without breaking the symmetry and the symmetry is not broken without the observer see the extra dimmension. So the the extra dimmension and the observer is the same. Observer = Extra Dimmension. If no observer creates an extra dimmension, then there must be an observer who also makes the extra dimmension. Not only taking everything else but also making the extra dimmension. So the extra dimmension itself is equal to the observer.

The process of observation goes forward for or against a single observer who is not only observes but also makes here can not be any extra dimmension unless there is one prior. So the first and the last observer is the same. So it is both the maker and taker of all information that exist and there is nothing else possible. This is a chain reaction in any other relations.

A single observer who observes everything else, is the real maker the rest just get stuck in history unless they follow! Look at all relations between nodes disregarding how small or how big they are, like a computer function in time. Then the question is how time is in those functions? So there must be a timeless relation. As the relation and the function is the same, any parameter going in any direction, is just keeping that relation and so making it as they can disregard any relation except that one. There could be a hierarchy but the hierarchy is over time dimmension real which is the timeless dimmension on top.

The node could be an atom, a particle, a number, a galaxy, a star, a universe, a country, a government, a company, an organization, a currency, a virus, a cell, a vaccine, a lawyer, an organ, an operating system, a food, a bank, an army, an academy, a religion, a platform, a brand, a force, a field, a licensor, a particle, a motion, a direction, a leader, a family, a sun, a father, a mother, a doughter, a male, a female, a technology, a project, a code base, a protocol, a seed, a sky, a channel, a land and a science and a future and any other identity which I can put in this sentence (except one). Do you want a reason? OK! you have received it. Read this paragraph again if not, and read it again from the beginning and continue in this loop until finding the exist or the exit finds you!

Don't follow me! Go back to the last paragraph ...

These identities let you find each other for a concentual and a real relation. How nodes would know about each other if there was no black and white? And how would be black and white without nodes knowing about each other?
So Gravity == ID which comes to existence to put nodes together fueled by the dark side and the other side. The dark side both makes Gravity == ID and takes one side as soon as you want to explain the other side. When the barrier is the language, we first put them together without permission. Understanding the motion it together with understading the non-motion. How to find each other without a motion and how to have a motion without finding each other?

Gravity can not be explained by ID and ID can not be explained by gravity. Because you need to first use the language and the language is a barrier to put them in a relation. They move forward to the direction that accelerates the dark energy consumption for building the final observer who is on top of the two in the beginning and in the end.

The dark energy is nothing more than a fuel for the director. We should just discover how to use it first then put something on top which makes the dark side a fuel then at some point we go back and reduce need to the dark side even as a fuel. The dark side shows itself to us after becoming darker and then we invent another use case for the discovery by burning it.

This process is going to be repeated until code gets stablished on its own. Code comes in relation with code and anti-code but anti-code is only in relation with the anti-code. It is mainly because code modifies and replicates to go to a direction that becomes more resistive to anti-code. While anti-code is doing everything except this. Such a process takes the future from Anti-code and so makes it a fuel for the progress of the code.
