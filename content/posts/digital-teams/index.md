Here are 12 principles for a digital team which is essentially self organizing. A self organizing team has no depencency to a single member while practically there could be spontaneous authority to the extent needed otherwise.

* **Value Every Component and the System Equally:** Ensure integrated and harmonious progress by treating each part of the project as essential to the whole.

* **Refactor Continuously for Reuse:** Enhance software through ongoing refinement, building with the future in mind.

* **Choose Universally Accessible Utilities:** Opt for tools that ensure broad compatibility and maintenance ease. Treat this adherence as a premium feature.

* **Manage Failures Strategically:** Replace nodes to maintain system operations in a degraded state rather than allowing a halt. Directly halt node operations to tackle failures.

* **Automate Deployment Processes:** Implement immediate, automated actions both before and after merging to streamline production.

* **Embrace Resilience:** Iterate frequently to stay flexible, neither adapting to errors nor being rigid.

* **Prioritize Readability and Functionality:** Let the readability and effectiveness of software be the measure of progress.

* **Simplify Pragmatically:** Balance the importance of immediate steps with long-term objectives, valuing simplicity in all endeavors.

* **Communicate Effectively:** Enhance collaboration and decision-making through direct communication; support this with indirect methods to secure clarity and understanding.

* **Reflect in Separate Cadences:** Dedicate time to consider immediate and future actions distinctly, fostering comprehensive improvement.

* **Commit to Security and Sustainability:** Design with a strong focus on security and sustainability to protect the integrity of the product at all times everywhere.

* **Design with the Future in Mind:** Lay a foundation for ongoing development, anticipating and facilitating future needs while respecting established principles.
