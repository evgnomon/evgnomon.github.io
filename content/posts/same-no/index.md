Have you heard the one saying that "You are like those save in non-Bitcoin. You see them as enemy and they see you as enemy and your fight is about getting power and when you overcome they are going to repeat the same and this is a pointless never ending war, and let's stop all wars and accept the current situation. We are all the same!"

OK! Assuming Bitcoin forgets Bitcoin, does the other side also forget Bitcoin?

Does the other side stop keeping and accumulating Bitcoin and or non-Bitcoin? Not only I lose Bitcoin but also everything else! Wouldn't I become a real threat to the other side later on? Then! They are going to ignore me then?

The one who saves in Bitcoin and only in Bitcoin isn't always different from others who mix it and those who mix it also agree with Bitcoin in some extent while Bitcoin doesn't agree with them in any extent about the future.
Even they leave some future to Bitcoin but Bitcoin never leaves any future to them. Are they the same?
Bitcoin doesn't consider any owner for the future, it considers the future as a whole and it is not going to leave any future to any owner. Is this the same with other ones?

Bitcoin doesn't allow owning the future to anyone else, is this the same as any other?
And there is no other future except eliminating Bitcoin, can you do it while Bitcoin planning everyday how to eliminate the other futures?
Is this the same?

If they are all the same, there must be one which is not! The main issue hidden in the first narrative.
Is that one Bitcoin? Otherwise it will be an endless war and Bitcoin is right.
