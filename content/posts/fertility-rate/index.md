Fertility rate should be two in average for sustainable population.
It is math.
Lower fertility rate means kids are not useful.

When I subscribe to a product, it becomes more useful later. The system gets accelerated. But if I opt out, it doesn't decline with the same rate, its growth will slow down but still grows as there are other subscribers. Less acceleration so to say. 
The same story is with kids but the price tag has a negative sign. Less they are used more useless it becomes in the next cycle. The system becomes less prepared, negative acceleration.

No need to put numbers belong to the last fifty years to show this, those numbers are the output of this simple feedback loop.

The fertility rate doesn't increase before the extinction ahead. It will keep being low and lower until a big event turn it back to sustainable levels. Perhaps a singularity changing everything else too.
