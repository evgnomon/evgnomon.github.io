Fertility rate should be two in average for sustainable population.
It is math.
Lower fertility rate means kids are not useful.

When I subscribe to a product, it becomes more useful later. The system gets accelerated and the price approaches zero. It becomes more attractive. The same story is with kids but the price tag has a negative sign. Less they are used more useless it becomes in the next cycle so the price tag increases to approach zero. It becomes less attractive.

Negative price for kids comes from the utility of a kid measured in long term. Like an investment. But loosing one more subscription for kids also increases the marginal cost for the next kid as the entire system shrinks in size and the cost for the next kid also increases. So the price tag increases from a negative baseline to zero makes the investment less attractive for individuals.

The return of the next kid is on the whole system while it has to return to the individuals paying for it. This never happens if adding one more kid to the system means extending the life for the system which has driven to have less kids. It will keep being low and lower until a big global event return it back to normal. Perhaps a singularity changing everything else too.

No need to put numbers belong to the last fifty years to show this, those numbers are the output of this simple feedback loop.

Subscription is always about acceleration. Depending to the subscription type it gets accelerated either by subscription or unsubscription. But could it be one thing that accelerates by subscription and accelerates but unsubscription too to the other direction? Nothing can be be like this as forces will build up in different directions until fall it apart due to debt. Except for a natural singularity which is debtless since the beginning.

So debt stabilises a system by putting opposite forces in different identities. At the same time puts the system on the verge of extinction in long term in benefit of one outsider kid which owns everything without need to pay for it! And others will need it to survive the extinction. So this only changes when that debtless kid gets born on an extinct planet.
