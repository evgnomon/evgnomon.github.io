![Government's Role](government.png)

In a society that naturally aims for balance and stability, both the government and individuals have important roles to play. The system will naturally evolve towards a fair and orderly state and it can be peaceful depending to the direction taken by the government. By understanding and embracing these roles, societies can achieve a state where laws are respected, governance is accountable, and everyone can grow individually and as a society by using the full capacity of each and every individual.

## The Government's Role: Ensuring Lawfulness and Accountability
The job, and only job, of the government is to follow the law itself and make sure others do too, essentially maintaining the boundaries of order. By acting legally, the government sets a good example and holds everyone to the same standards. This helps maintain order and prevents misuse of power. Like keeping drivers accountable to traffic rules, or a referee in a game, the government is supposed to enforce legal rules.

Governments must ensure that all actions are legal, creating a trustworthy and stable society. When people see that the laws apply to everyone, including the government, it builds confidence and maintains social order. People can hold the government accountable to the code of law and change it if necessary. As the government essentially runs the law, finding a new government that adheres to the same laws should be straightforward. This can be periodically done by the individuals through elections. A legal government won't reject this check. Otherwise it is probably not a legal government.

## The Individuals' Role: Innovators and Creators
While the government ensures legality, individuals drive change and improvement. They update laws, create new business ideas, advance technology, and tell new stories. These efforts collectively shape a better future.

Individuals ideally are active participants in society, always looking for ways to adapt and improve. Their innovations solve problems and inspire others, helping society respond to new challenges. Individuals are the ones who are supposed to change the code. They are typically those willing to leave the current law in favour of the new. If stopped, they will be pushed to the edge of the society, and the society will lose its potential to grow to the same extent. And at some point leaving the society will be the only option for them.

## A Self-Regulating Society
The interaction between a lawful government and innovative individuals creates a self-regulating society.

The government ideally is a reflection of the individuals. A government that stops modifications to the code doesn't truly exist; In that situation, what really exists is an individual who has failed to find the modifying code. The government runs the code, while individuals are the coders. The code always exists to the extent autonomously adopted and is always changing. A government that actively tries to stop change is not a government. It unfortunately creates chaos where actions cancel each other out. Ultimately leaving the government in disarray compared to others.

Individuals participate in different contracts and can also participate temporarily in the government to form a different government. But this relationship is not reciprocal; the government cannot really take control from individuals to form a different society. Such attempts will inevitably fail regardless of the size of the society, if even one individual remains independent. Thus, these actions must be legal, and mechanisms should exist for individuals to prevent such overreach by the government.

Regardless of the structure of the government, it is a single body referring to the same law and using the same armed force. There is no excuse for the government to violate the first principle of the law: the government itself being legal. Being legal means allowing individuals to understand the code and modify it in a civilized manner. This applies equally to foreign relations. The government must be legal in the eyes of its citizens and other governments to form relations based on mutual respect and understanding. Otherwise, citizens and other governments should be able to leave it in favor of a new type of relationship.

The government can always follow or unfollow policies, but the first principle, which is being legal, is permanent, and the government is always responsible for it. Being legal does not require an illegal entity for protection or promotion. Law is protected by a legal government, among other things, and law protects a legal government. A legal government protects individual rights, and individual rights protect law and the legal government. And law protects individual rights. None of these three entities are self-sufficient, and there is a clear boundary between them. Law is a text run by the government, like a computer program run by a computer. And the individual is the one who chooses which code is run by computers, including the government as a computer.

All three are chosen: I choose what type of individual I am, I choose what type of government I want, and I choose what type of code I adopt. And I can change any of them at any time. I am the reality. We are.
