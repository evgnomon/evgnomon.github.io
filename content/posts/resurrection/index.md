Buying gold seems like a good idea for those who want to retire early, wherever they are. Even better with Bitcoin, as Bitcoin not only offers that for long-term holders but also raises the question of what to do after retirement.

The main advantage of Bitcoin is that I can not only hold it but also directly engage with the Bitcoin network. I can run a node, I can mine wherever there is power, and build real relationships with others, regardless of the financial scale of that relationship! Consensual at a global distance. I can do all sorts of things that are not directly possible with gold as money.

Bitcoin is not controlled by any central authority; it can also force other authorities to be accountable for their actions, including central banks, regardless of how much gold or other assets they reserve. Otherwise, why don’t they join the Bitcoin network to retire early like me? Bitcoin also lets you question other authorities.

What should I do with the remainder if I can retire early with Bitcoin? This is a question for anyone else who has retired early. This question brings us all together. I can do whatever I want with my time, regardless of my age, color, nationality, gender, or anything else. This is the first and last resurrection, which also dissolves any other virtual ones unless they align in the same direction. Not an end, but a startup!

You don’t come alone in this; your steps bring others too, and others bring more. Virtually a chain reaction. It only requires talking! Your food will be enriched, your water will be cleaner, your air will be fresher, your life will be longer, and your time will be truly meaningful. You will be on a mission—not alone, but possible alone. For sure, time ticks for you, you can optionally tick for time too.

This resurrection is not virtual; it is the only real one.
