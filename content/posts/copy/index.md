Copy! Not the material, but the information.
That is the most efficient way to build up one lasting thing.
We need to build up one lasting thing as that is the only possible end.

Looking at stock indices, you find a lot of technology companies, but technology is algorithms. The rest are just information silos. We'll return the information back to users, sell subscriptions to tools running those open algorithms! Instead of closing the source, just leave the source for the people and make them subscribers to the essentials! Something that saves a lot of time for them. Everyone can make a breakfast, but some don't have the time. That is where you can work for them so they can find time work for you.

Technology and algorithms will be just created without any patent rights! The investment will still happen since the technique is more efficient with innovation. Somebody else goes ahead of me if I don't make any innovation!

And investment will also happen even if you take your asset into your grave! Next time you want to find the real value of a stock index, look at how they are producing it and just assume at some point there would be no one working in those factories. How much value would they have? Would they then become just a warehouse or assembly line? Otherwise, perhaps there is something valuable in it.

So the answer of what is the ROI of this investment, is both "infinite" and "zero" at the same time. You just find it when you measure it. So it is not a good question! As if it is zero you leave, if that is infinite it is already been invested! So it is always too late for that question.

It is much better to ask, what is next to build for the one that is going to leave in the space, outside the factories without human.
