> Back fires! Prepare for them, with all the strength and readiness you are able to, a force that consumes their resolve and binds their advance, so you may deter your biggest enemy and your enemyâ€”along with others beyond them, unknown to you but known in the end. Whatever you expend in the way for the one who owns the end, will be restored to you as a reserve, and you will not be wronged.

Nothing separates your consumption/production being your income or being your reserve! Therefore consumption is neither from your income/spending nor from your reserve/investment! Any miss calculation on this wipes you out of a future while being a burning fuel for it!

Consumption/Production is not from reserve unless from income and not from income unless from reserve.

I don't need to eat/read what I already digested/written! Instead, I take the enemy's exhaust as a reserve and give it back to itself and I eat my own reminder food which I already left for myself and to the same amount stop my enemy's food. Z <- (X, Y) and (-Y, X) -> iZ therefore: Z = X + iY! Why? Why why?

That is my enemy who is eating digested food and producing and enforcing digest to others, and all that is a reserve for me while they lose food to the same amount that I send reminder for myself which leaves a loss for the enemy too! And what they want to do if I send everything needed for a leaving as a reminder? Is this more than a digital home and a digital office with everything else that is needed to fill the gap? Do they want further than a secured and independent digital civilization for us?
