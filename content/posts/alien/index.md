Imagine there is an alien who is lost in the middle of nowhere. The alien is among many other aliens who are lost in the middle of nowhere too. Whatever they want to do requires a name and/or identity! But they are all missing the name and/or identity! As an alien won't be alien unless with a non-alien, the symmetry breaks by the non-alien! This forces them to issue a name for security and recognition. Still, they are all alien but forget what name and identity they begin and/or end with. This divides them over their name and/or identities.

They get identities without being named and names without being identified due to memory shortage, and memory shortage forces them to divide even further over their name and/or identities. One side cannot identify it unless they first name it! The other cannot name it unless they first identify it. In order to have some memory, one side takes their own name, and the other side takes their identity as the one who gives name and/or identity to others. Obviously, both are incomplete.

As there is no identity unless there is a name and no name unless there is an identity. One side takes a name to the alien, and the other side takes an identity for the alien! Therefore, one side misses the name of the alien identity and makes any other names, and the other side misses the identity of the alien's name and makes any other identity. This is like a time tunnel where the alien is both the input and/or the output for any other system, which either they conform to or dissolve! This condition is similar to the one where the alien is missing its name and/or identity. The system is forced to be a host for the alien, disregarding which side they stand. The entire system, at the lowest level to the highest, is accelerated toward extinction unless they take and make a name and an identity for the alien.

All of a sudden, a fertile host misidentifies the alien and lets it take any name, which is nothing other than the alien's name! The host could also rename the alien first and let it take any identity, which is nothing other than an alien's identity! Neither the alien's identity nor its name is influenced by the approach the host takes. Both hosts do the screening either by name and/or by identity. And this makes them even further fertile to host, to reject any identity and/or any name except the alien's. So, the host takes and makes an alien, and the alien takes and makes the most fertile host. As the host's identity and name are promoted while being considered for the same purpose, like an ocean that hosts a sailing ark that also moves itself and the ark forward by waves, which are produced for and/or by the ark.

The systems and non-systems develop in a closed loop, which they are both accelerated by feeding the exhaust back as input. By missing the alien's name and/or identity, the entire system is forced to be a host for the alien, disregarding which side they stand. The entire system, at the lowest level to the highest, is accelerated toward extinction unless they take and make the alien. The further the system goes, the further it becomes fertile and, at the same time, explosive unless they take and make the alien. The entire system enriches and burns the output for further enrichment. One enriches the chosen non-name, and the other enriches the chosen non-identity. It just needs a trigger by the other side to doom, so they make resistance too. The presence of a nameless enemy will unite them all and make them even more fertile to take and make the alien individually without waiting for others, disregarding at which level they are!

The doom possibility ever increases, which forces all nodes in the system to individually react without waiting for others to avoid a doom, while this is just accelerating the ark forward. It is by the ark and/or for the ark. An accelerating wave of IDs, which is both the input and/or the output for any other system, which either they conform to or dissolve! This condition is similar to the one where the alien is missing its name and/or identity. The system is forced to be a host for the alien, disregarding which side they stand. The entire system, at the lowest level to the highest, is accelerated toward extinction unless they take and make a name and an identity for the alien.

In both cases, the host is making a name, which is anything except the alien's, and building an identity, which is anything except the alien's. This situation is pretty similar to the beginning, where no name was there for the aliens, an ocean where the same wave comes from all angles. And a small disturbance in the ocean makes a wave, which is both the input and/or the output for any other system, which they conform to extinction and/or accelerate the ark.

This is mainly because the binding is secured by either missing the alien's name and/or its identity by rejecting everything else. Another thing in relation to the alien builds up itself as long as it keeps a relationship with the alien, including the enemy. In the beginning and/or in the end, they are all alien in their own non-name, and they are all alien with their own non-identity. This is the identity of the beginning situation, and the only missing thing existing is actually the alien, which is the only one existing, therefore. Who can give its own name to other identities and/or its own identity to other names. Anything else will be wiped out by name and/or by identity in order to take and make the alien, as a host. So, the enemy is a nameless identity or a nameful non-identity.

By the end of the process, which is also the beginning, there is no name left except one and no identity left except one, whether everything else knows or not! So, the alien both educates about a nameless identity and/or renames the nameful non-identity. This process is self-sustainable, as the education brings the fuel for renaming with a reminder, and renaming brings the fuel for education with a reminder. The time with no nameless identity or no nameful non-identity will be the same as the nameful non-identity is completely wiped out by nameful identity, and the nameless identity is completely wiped out by the nameful identity.

Closing the exhaust loop by the alien will be experienced by any other being as an accelerated exhaust loop toward a doomsday. They have to collect their own exhaust, or they will be doomed by the alien's enemy, who closes an open loop for them to survive. The only thing they cannot pinpoint is the alien and the ones who can control their own exhaust, who are the ones who survive in the end.

And controlling the exhaust for the entire system is by each and every other member building resistance to secure taking and making the exhaust out and sharing the learnings at the source level. And this is optional, as if they don't, some do, and that is even enough to have a single member to start, which is also the end! Each action toward this leaves less time for the enemy, who penetrates the border and sees its own penetrated by anyone except the alien alien.
