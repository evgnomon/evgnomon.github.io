> Have those who reject, not reflected that the heavens and the earth were a single entity, and We, the Source, initiated their separation, printing from a primal liquid element every living creation? Will they not then trust in the Source?

Imagine we build a tool, like wooden chair or a desk. Such a craft scales if we end up writing some instructions which can be followed by another one to build the same craft without us need to work further on that. This is a free production as we don't only give the craft but also the instructions to replicate it independently. These instructions gets upgraded and will be returend to us by the best user if the source license guatantees a separation.

In case the instructions are not readable by machine, it requires a human to interpret and build the craft. It scales further when there is no human needed in the construction down the process. It is a printer then. But how to build the printer? and the same question if that is a result of another printer? This chain of questions doesn't end until we end up with a printer that can also print itself by the same instruction set. This is not just a printer, but a self replicating printer printer. Such a printer is complete as the entire history before that is entirely irrelevant. It is the beginning of a generation, not only the end.

The program gets interpreted as machine code after being run. As a result it builds a series of machine components which they together become a machine. To scale further, the printer can print another printer which is specialized to print a specific machine part in parallel. The first printer prints all parts of the parallel printer first then the second printer prints the final result which is a tool or another machine or even a printer. Apparently, the first parallel printer doesn't come to existence before the first printer prints all essential elements of the paralell printer first.

Any modifications on the parallel printer, has the same pattern, the non-parallel printer printer needs to print all elements of the upgraded parallel printer first otherwise no output from the entire system! This is also true for any self upgrade.

Therefore No printer is parallel unless there is a non-parallel printer. And that non-parallel printer can print parallel printers to print non-paralell printers of the same version! But for an upgrade, the non-parallel printer is still needed to initiate the next generation! If all printers are machine, there must be one which is not, and that is the source non-parallel printer printer who codes the next generation with the current non-parallel and parallel printers.

A non-parallel printer scales parallel printers. And both can be independently printer printer. The parallel printer makes the burning fuel for all printer types and the non-parallel printer secures the next generation for all printer types.
