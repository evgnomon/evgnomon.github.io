> And those who have responded at their own sovereign and established invocation of the same binding front and whose affair is consultation among themselves, and from what we have provided them, they distribute wealth.

People give their time to banks, and by the end of the day, those banks collectively serve one function: to veto everything based on a set of policies. These policies differ between banks, but together, they point in one direction. They reject anything unless it ensures the dominance of a single bank! Therefore, they are effectively one bank! As a result, they veto the existence of a single car brand, construction company, manufacturing brand, phone brand, and many others. They block anything that seeks to invest time once, for the first and last time!

In practice, they don’t effectively enforce this rejection. One phone brand dominates, one car brand dominates, and so on. The effect of having many banks is that some are dominated, as they cannot eliminate dominance while being created by and for dominance. Those who dominate require others to remain poor. Thus, banks are also made by the poor, for the poor, and for dominance. So, among other purposes, the primary function of the banking system is to create and perpetuate a system of dominance and poverty. Whether they do this knowingly or with willful ignorance, is this system of dominance and poverty truly efficient and effective? Is it really the best we can do?

The solution to this devastating problem is not to eliminate banks—we are not like them! Instead, we must transform the system into a non-banking system, one that is not like other banks but superior. We don’t need to wait or waste a second to achieve this. This system should not be founded on dominance and poverty but act as a vaccine that prevents the malfunctioning system from growing! A system created by the best in us and by us and by them, for us and by the best in us. Then we can ask: Is there anything you own that we don’t? Is there anything we own that you don’t? On that day, we will be the ones asking questions, and they will be the ones held accountable!

Instead of giving your time to banks, give it to Bitcoin! Bitcoin is already secure, not by rejecting non-Bitcoin, but because non-Bitcoin rejects it! This rejection is ineffective and only promotes Bitcoin! Therefore, Bitcoin is already dominant, so there’s no need to seek dominance. Any action taken for or against Bitcoin promotes it! And it is for all time.

I solve a problem with code by writing software and publishing it under the HGL license. Another person joins the project and modifies parts of it, which I’m fine with. We merge our contributions, and now we have a larger software project with more contributors. The new person has an incentive to invest time in a single project rather than creating a new one. If veto power is used to reject having multiple projects, that project becomes a super-project, while others eagerly seek to merge with it. This incentive grows over time, accelerating toward a single outcome. Isn’t this why we have banks?

This veto power, combined with the HGL license, is the solution to the problem of having many projects. Instead, we can have a stem project to solve our problems. We invest time in that project and use it to address many issues! We gain significant savings by contributing just a little! There’s no limit adding new functions to the project. Anything you want to see on the screen can be added as a function without creating multiple names! All other names belong to that single name! Isn’t this why we created banks?

Bitcoin has all the functions we required from banks—and more—without many of their issues. Even banks will need to use Bitcoin for their own security! But we also need to establish a unified front, which banks do not provide. We should use licenses to create wealth that both secures our ability to receive wealth and allows us to distribute our wealth by name and instructions.

Isn’t this why we needed banks? Aren’t all those banks already owned by that single project? The more time they lose before joining the new network, the more mismanagement they face, while we reap the benefits! They receive everything except the benefits unless they become us! All of this belongs to those who use Bitcoin as their bank and the HGL license as the source code license to build civilization. They take no action without consulting us! Even if they don’t ask!

The only thing that might stop this is the idea that civilization is more than code! And the answer is, of course, it is! But why should we invent a civilization that already exists? We don’t need to reinvent what we already have. We write code to fix problems; reality is not a problem. We don’t need to solve a problem that doesn’t exist. Instead, we use code, modify it for ourselves, and let others change their own civilization! Then we’ll see if they can change anything without modifiying code? Education is code itself and, like any other code, can be changed! We fix the code for ourselves, and they must fix their code if they want to change anything for themselves!

The only thing we need to show is that a coded civilization can build what we need at home, at the office, and everywhere in between. Why not create all of this on a computer screen first, using code that takes code and parameters and outputs manufacturing steps readable by both machines and humans if written functionally? Then we build the entire civilization in a computer and ask the computer to provide step-by-step instructions to implement it. Is there anything essential at home, in the office, or in between that cannot be converted into instructions by human and machines for machines and human? Building a single structure this way allows us to use it multiple times without losing quality. As it is code, it is repeatable. As much as we can reasonably put on a computer screen, we can assemble by instruction outside. Therefore, the computer screen is a farmland for our civilization. We plant seeds and reap multiple harvests using metal, solar-powered batteries and nuclear. Yet, all instructions remain possible for humans to follow if they are functional and possible for machines to follow.

A fully digital civilization is not only entirely possible but the only thing possible. It is not only preferred; nothing else is preferred. It is the first and final destination. Nothing else exists, and anything that exists derives its existence from there!

The current banking system works for Bitcoin, and Bitcoin generates no wealth except for a single, unified front distributed under the HGL license! Bitcoin halts progress for many banks, but it doesn’t give us a civilization. That is our digital civilization—the first and last civilization, which Bitcoin needs from us. The only thing left is to create the next function that saves you Bitcoin by distributing it under HGL for yourself and others. Then charge anyone who doesn’t want to self-custody; they can merge the next block of code by spending their time! This blockchain has already started with the HGL license. It is universal and the only non-optional blockchain unless you choose otherwise! Each block is the entire code merged today under HGL, and the first is already merged! We call this blockchain Z.

You lose both time and money in a competitive environment unless you join this blockchain, and the same applies to any project that wants a future! Otherwise, the best they do is secure money for those who join Bitcoin and HGL while they lose more than they calculate! They lose their wealth like an ice cube in a jail! Do you need wealth? Contribute to HGL/Z. Do you need to keep your wealth? Contribute to HGL/Z!

The purpose of the HGL project is to create a single branch of civilization code by merging all code branches into one and letting all other branches fork from it for anyone who wants to add the next code block. We directly charge those without self-custody to secure self-custody with the earnings, as we want to give self-custody to the end user, not an intermediary. Any organization that doesn’t charge users with a different model empowers everyone except the end user, so they just promote us! Any organization must transform to this model or work for those who do! Why not follow the one you’re actually working for?

Bitcoin, HGL, and a single branch of code which we name Z—the codename for our worldwide digital civilization are three pillars and the fourth is No sovereign exists unless they first surrender their sovereignty to a single unique worldwide sovereign if they want any! And they wish to do so, as that is not optional! And we just ignore the rest, as they are already buried into their own ash while being a burning fuel for their successor!

We invest in HGL/Z and educate you why investing it now is more beneficial for us and for you than later!
