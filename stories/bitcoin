Bitcoin is 21M coins, so it is definitely scarce. If precious metals like Gold
and Silver are scarce, and if Bitcoin is scarce, the sum of two scarce is also
scarce. But the difference is that scarecity of Bitcoin is contracted while
Gold and silver scarcity depends on how many mine is accessible. Perhaps they
are abandon if we access other planets. And all those materials need a
contracted scarcity for transfer, one way or another. Sum of two scarce is also
scarce which is why there could be a few other alternatives to Bitcoin with
different technology, name and such. Those could be ignored like how holders of
those coins may want to ignore Bitcoin. That is not changing anything for
Bitcoin holders and scarecity properties of Bitcoin either. So we just think
about Bitcoin and ignore the rest. I choose Bitcoin over Gold and such since
tons of it can be transferred in a second. And not other contracted scarecity
as there is no need to them as long as Bitcoin exists.

The limit which is 21M coins is just a random number as the total market cap of
Bitcoin wouldn't be different if it was any other number. It could be any
number.  So I just name them coins. A coin which does not have a an upper limit
does not make sense because  why not to change the protocol and increase the
supply rate? So the total number of coins should be fixed otherwise it can not
be scarce as it could be produced at any rate later without anyone want to
disagree with it. If someone wants to disagree with this later, it should
probably choose Bitcoin now. Such a coin need to be converted to Bitcoin to
save value!

All holders of bitcoin have the same identity I call them all Satoshi. More
people adopt bitcoin, more people become Satoshi. The game starts where it
ends.

Satoshi works. Proves some work and earns in result. As the main rule Satoshi
converts all the income to Bitcoin and start consuming it. Depending what is
going to be bought, he needs to convert it to some currency accepted by the
merchant. So over each period, Satoshi produces demand for Bitcoin and
supplies Bitcoin upon consumption. There would be some saved coin to be
consumed later, and some for ever which then the demand of the coin as always
going to be more than the supply for an enough large time window. Especially
Satoshi does not need to convert the coin to something else unless needed which
makes the currency ever growing in terms of anything else. This makes it
attractive for others to invest on the coin, which creates even more demand for
the coin and makes Satoshi rich and so being Satoshi even more attractive, so
spikes in the rate and such, when people see the future right now! Such spikes
pumps everything else into Satoshi's pocket.

As the coin conversion rate depends on many factors, like how much Satoshi can
work, how much others are willing to pay to Satoshi, how much people accept
bitcoin as the standard and such, the rate which the coin converts to other
currencies has up and down. This generates loss and profit for some investors
and pushes the rates up and down further. But satoshi will work, and works more
and more efficient to earn more coins disregarding what the exchange rate is.
The rate is determined in an ongoing auction since the coin is scarce and there
are many that would like to buy it first unless there is no one left that is no
satoshi! So satoshi can not choose the rate, but can choose to earn more coins
each period. Can choose to spend coins in a smart way to increase coin earnings
in future as there is a limited number of coins and those earn more, leave less
for others.

As we can see, the only factor determining how much coin Satoshi can earn is
time and robust, efficient and more work! The system works in a way which the
exchange rate of the coin increases in time over any other non scarce and
scarce thing, the way the coin is spent becomes more smart in time, efficiency
of work gets increased in time and innovation comes at highest demand to reduce
the consumption rate of the coins which makes things abandon for Satoshi and a
hell for non-satoshis which even makes it more attractive for others to adopt
the coin as the currency.

All that comes from a property which is scarecity of the money and accepting
the coin as the standard which no one can decide except Satoshi! So Satoshi has
shown us a way to determine your own destiny, to show you your right without
waiting for anything else. You can choose to be Satoshi from now.

The rules of being satoshi is this:

1- Only accept Bitcoin
2- Spend less Bitcoin as it will buy more later, makes your coin more valuable
(save time from yourself, smart consumption)
3- Earn more Bitcoin, as it makes everyone else's Bitcoin more valuable (save
time from others, lasting innovation)

You can start from today.
