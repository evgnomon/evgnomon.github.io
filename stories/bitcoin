Bitcoin is 21M coins, so it is definitely scarce even more than how Gold and
Silver are scarce. if Bitcoin is scarce, the sum of two scarce is also scarce.
So a basket of Gold and Silver and Bitcoin is scarce. But the difference is
that scarecity of Bitcoin is proveable. Not only because it is contracted but
also since it does not need bank deposit to make transactions, so no bank can
lend the coin multiple times to make multiple owner for the same thing.

The limit which is 21M coins is just a random number as the total market size
of Bitcoin wouldn't be different if it was any other number. A coin type which
does not have a an upper limit is maintained by those that want to change the
protocol and increase the supply rate later. If someone wants to disagree with
this, they would probably need to choose Bitcoin.

Satoshi is anyone which has adopted Bitcoin as the standard currency. Satoshi
asks Bitcoin in exchange of performing work. As anything with demand has price,
Bitcoin has a price higher than Zero as long as Satoshi works. For the same
reason it is not in benefit of Satoshi to totally stop working disregarding how
much it is reserved both to reach higher value for the reserve by collecing
more coins out of the market and also to not loose income. Which is why Bitcoin
price is not Zero and has tendency to increase as coins out of Satoshi's hand
is melting down as Satoshi performs work.

The value of Bitcoin is increasing due to shortage of supply which is even more
in future. This true even if no new adopter takes Bitcoin as standard or even
if some leave it by releasing the reserves into the market. In the other hand
we know that properties of Bitcoin makes it ideal to be adopted by those that
perform work. Those do not need to change to something else later as standard
currency.

Satoshi works. Proves some work and earns in result. As the main rule Satoshi
converts all the income to Bitcoin and start consuming it. Depending what is
going to be bought, he needs to convert it to some currency accepted by the
merchant. So over each period, Satoshi produces demand for Bitcoin and supplies
Bitcoin upon consumption. There would be some saved coin to be consumed later,
and some for ever which then the demand of the coin as always going to be more
than the supply for an enough large time window. Especially Satoshi does not
need to convert the coin to something else unless needed which makes the
currency ever growing in terms of anything else. This makes it attractive for
others to invest on the coin, which creates even more demand for the coin and
makes Satoshi rich and so being Satoshi even more attractive, so spikes in the
rate and such, when people see the future right now! Such spikes pumps
everything else into Satoshi's pocket.

As the coin conversion rate depends on many factors, like how much Satoshi can
work, how much others are willing to pay to Satoshi, how much people accept
bitcoin as the standard and such, the rate which the coin converts to other
currencies has up and down. This generates loss and profit for some investors
and pushes the rates up and down further. But satoshi will work, and works more
and more efficient to earn more coins disregarding what the exchange rate is.
The rate is determined in an ongoing auction since the coin is scarce and there
are many that would like to buy it first unless there is no one left that is no
satoshi! So satoshi can not choose the rate, but can choose to earn more coins
each period. Can choose to spend coins in a smart way to increase coin earnings
in future as there is a limited number of coins and those earn more, leave less
for others.

As we can see, the only factor determining how much coin Satoshi can earn is
time and robust, efficient and more work! The system works in a way which the
exchange rate of the coin increases in time over any other non scarce and
scarce thing, the way the coin is spent becomes more smart in time, efficiency
of work gets increased in time and innovation comes at highest demand to reduce
the consumption rate of the coins which makes things abandon for Satoshi and a
hell for non-satoshis which even makes it more attractive for others to adopt
the coin as the currency.

All that comes from a property which is scarecity of the money and accepting
the coin as the standard which no one can decide except Satoshi! So Satoshi has
shown us a way to determine your own destiny, to show you your right without
waiting for anything else. You can choose to be Satoshi from now.

The rules of being satoshi is this: Only accept Bitcoin
