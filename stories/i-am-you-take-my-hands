The story starts from where I can put some pieces of hardware to make a computer for myself.
A processor which can run a set of instruction to apply some functions on an input data stored in memory.
That program can run again and again no new input to improve the result.
And my friends and family ask me to setup the same for them since working with computer makes things far more efficient.

I get into problems to scale my work:
1- shoertage of access to hardware
2- changes in hardware interfaces and incompatiblities
3- Many documents need to be verified to make sure things are working properly
4- And the software is made by many including some which is built by me and need to work on my machine

I make an architecture and protocols to address all these in a way that I‌ can let others have this computer and use programs without going into things which could be addressed once for all. This is activity requires time and resources so need to be financed and paid. I sell the computer and everything in it to others and they can just turn it one and work with it. I‌ need small screen, slightly larger one, a portable version, a big one to put on my desk and the same things in different situations.

But if that is that simple, then we should have one company doing this in a way that all can depend on. If I can buy such a computer, if that is accessible everywhere, if there is going to be accessible forever and such, there is no need to have many companies producing the same thing. But there is many and one of them is Apple! So there is some issue somewhere let's wait before blaming someone for this. For example, Apple must follow US export regulations then the state can restrcit Apple to do what same as the way Apple's board can restrict being working on some region. So Apple is not fully owned by the investors it is also owned by the US‌A's nation. So it is connected to policits. So it can not be used everywhere, it can not be bought by all either.

Making another apple does not solve the problem. For example making one independent in China! Or in another place. But wait what was the issue we tried to solve in the beginning? I have a bunch of hardwares which they are not compatible, a bunch of programs which are written by others, many documents, and all these are changing and has to reliably work with eachother. Well, the problem is still there so it is shifted to someone else. The problem is shifted from me to the producer side. I‌ chosoe Apple and just do not care the rest. If I can not use it, I just move and live somewhere which I can use it. This makes that product even more useful in a specific region and not others.

In the world that we are living, companies is "our" company not others. So I do not blame Apple that does not work in some regions, they can not. And I do not blame them but not making their product open source either, since I do not give the source code unless I want to have someone work for me. And those want to get what I build for myself can buy a copy from me! I know how things better work for me so you as a company need to adopt yourself to me.

The solution is not to leave Apple, since then we should use something even worse. I can make it better working for me.
The solution is not Android either! Google can stop sharing important pieces, can stop sharing alltogether. Google is receiving code from other companies which is why the source code is open and it is not a free software either since they want to keep some rights reserved to be able to control. They solve no problem from me and add even more in a more complicated way, they expsoe me to even more counter party risk. Their product is not cheap, I‌ am just their product!

The number one rule is to pay for what you receive and If I could keep things in my control, for my own by paying it (by spending time and energy), why you do not pay me to keep things also in your control like I do?
