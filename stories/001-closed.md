There are some things that I do not really have the time and want to change it,
For example the email application could be built by a single company and sold
to us! There are many users of that application and small profit can justify
having a lasting company. The company can protect the application, improve it
and support it. That simplicity is the way to scale and have the software work
for all.

The purpose is to solve the common problem and it can mean to build a hardware
for it. A hardware which is tuned for the software. Lease the hardware, use it
and upgrade it every few years. The purpose I buy the hardware and the software
running on that is to solve the problem as simple as possible.

But this is not the entire story, there might be another case which I can
modify the software and I am dedicated to support it for others tool. In that
situation I need to have something giving me right to first port it to my
hardware and also modify it to fit my needs. This is a separate scenario which
a software with a proper license would give to me.

And there are some other cases which a software has been used a lot to solve
some certain problems. For example office problems or business problem domain
which things are defined at the organization level and being adapted there.
For example a business email could be a lot different than the personal
calendar depending the organization needs.

So one size does not fit all! There are situations that one is preferred to the
other and I do not see that why we shouldn't use the preferred approach where
it applies. I would rather to choose then I need options.
