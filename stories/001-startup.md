# Start up!

I use my mobile every day, I call my dad and the mother and some friends
and some time order a pizza and send emails to the school, which is was a
gift my dad gave me once I turned into 13. It has a small screen. I saw a
laptop in an electrical shop on a big shopping mall! And get intersted to
buy a laptop! The one which looks more attractive, easier to use, better
display with long lasting battery! I want to buy it! But I don't have
enough money well I use my father's credit card or my mother's credit card!
Or just wait a few more months and save some money to buy it. But the story
does not end here!

After a while, I just get noticed that the one which looks fancy or and
more featured is not always useful for me. I want to install some games on
it which it does not work, it does not have certain graphic processor. I
was recommended by a friend to try the game which requires the processor.
And sometime I think I would like to have a better CPU! But the still we
have not paid all the debt for the first purchase. Maybe I need a desktop.

There are more issues, I have to pay for everything I need while I can some
time build it for myself. But I can not change the software running on my
laptop. Sometime I can but most of the time not! Many tools that I use just do
not support my laptop.

I want to buy the desktop machine with free software installed on. I can run
the same software on a server machine. The server is located in my city which a
friend of mine has bought and rents it to us. Here receives the rent using
Bitcoin. So I can run my software on their machine while mine is off. They have
recently bought one more machine since there are more interested to their
machines.

So now I have laptop and a mobile and a desktop and a server which is rented
from my friend. With the mobile and the laptop I just handle my daily tasks.
There are many applications available for sending email, I just use the one
which was installed on the device, that just works for me. I have many options
though. Some of them are paid but cheap. So what I want to do is to build my
own system.
