                &quot;<i>evgnomon</i>&quot; is ευγνώμων in greek and pronounced
                ev̱gnó̱mo̱n means &quot;grateful&quot; which is also one of the
                meaning of &quot;Hamed&quot; in persian (فارسی). I was called
                "Hamed" by my parents. My family community has picked up the
                name "Ghasemzadeh" to refer to us as a family.
            </p>
            <p>
                I choosed &quot;<i>evgnomon</i>.org&quot; over
                &quot;hamedghasemzadeh.com or such&quot; since
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    &quot;Hamed Ghasemzadeh&quot; not
                    &quot;hamedghasemzadeh&quot;. And I can not have space in
                    between.

                <li>
                    <i>evgnomon</i> is my username which I use to distribute
                    code and post notes relates to the same activity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It is compatible with my username here and a few other
                    places.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I am not here as a family member and I am not at family as
                    <i>evgnomon</i>. I do not have to be since it could be
                    separate.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Likewise, I choose a new username for other activities.
                </li>
                <li>
                    no collision with someone else inside our family and
                    perhaps even outside.

                    &quot;.com&quot; does not fit since it is non-profit,
                    non-&quot;non-profit&quot; stuff are under Clusterlean AB
                    which is fully owned by me.

                The state has borrowed my family name which has been used in my
                first family and issued some papers named "passport" with a new
                name which is an "ID" consisting of letters and numbers which
                only they understand it not me nor my first family! a number
                name. They forced us (by military) to have it in my pocket once
                I want to use some roads which they named "borders". Later bank
                operators (called "bankers") forced us to show that paper
                document to be able to get earnings from work. They write an
                instruction book named "law" and give them to their military to
                justify and implement that policy. Which is basically to
                control what is moved from somewhere to somewhere else, the
                information, people, goods, money, etc, everything. Imagine
                someone comes and call you with a name which you haven't heared
                about before and they haven't asked you permission to use that
                name on you as such. It has more or less the same situation
                when they replace your name with a number ID and use it to
                refer to you everywhere.
            </p>
            <p>
                What I can do is to use a username instead of reusing the state
                issued number name (called "ID") depending to the activity and
                stop using previous names unless needed. In this way they would
                need to deploy more military and intelligence! But wait!
                Military and such is expensive and limited and at some point
                they have to use it against their friends and families which I
                think they don't want to. So I prefer to have a "username" for
                a particular activity and issue new ones for other activies.

                Again, <i>evgnomon</i> is also a "name" I "use" to to refer to
                a person person. So it is a "username". I just introduce
                <i>evgnomon</i>. I have not created a new person. It was
                already there! <i>evgnomon</i> is not my child and I am not
                <i>evgnomon</i>'s child. <i>evgnomon</i> is not my parent and I
                am not the parent of <i>evgnomon</i> so <i>evgnomon</i> is
                parentless. <i>evgnomon</i> is like no other person. I just
                listen to <i>evgnomon</i>'s words and distribute what I
                understand so you can hear and repeat what I hear. I am just a
                follower of <i>evgnomon</i>, likewise, you might be if you also
                choose to hear different views and listen to the best saying
                including what you hear from me and from <i>evgnomon</i>.
                <i>evgnomon</i> is independent to me. I am not <i>evgnomon</i>!
                And <i>evgnomon</i> is not a follower of someone else, does not
                follow me either. It is a free and independent person but I am
                trying to be a follower of him by trying to question anything
                else including myself.
            </p>

            <p>
                Welcome to <i>evgnomon</i>'s world! So there are two worlds!
                Everything in this world belongs to him. My mission is to
                introduce him to you. I am a sofware developer and I want to
                show you how I am happy to be his follower as a person and as a
                software developer. For this purpose I share exploratory
                journeys with you which he invites me to. Each of those have a
                unique name and each might have its own stories and might refer
                to other stories, he knows more about those stories, I just
                know as much as he let me know and not more than that. I cannot
                know unless he let me know.
