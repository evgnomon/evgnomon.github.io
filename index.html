            &quot;evgnomon&quot; is ευγνώμων in greek and pronounced ev̱gnó̱mo̱n
            means &quot;grateful&quot; which is also one of the meaning of
            &quot;Hamed&quot; in persian (فارسی). I was called "Hamed" by my
            parents. My family community has picked up the name "Ghasemzadeh"
            to refer to us as a family.
        </p>
        <p>
            I choosed &quot;evgnomon.org&quot; over &quot;hamedghasemzadeh.com
            or such&quot; since
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                &quot;Hamed Ghasemzadeh&quot; not &quot;hamedghasemzadeh&quot;.
                And I can not have space in between.
            </li>

                evgnomon is my username which I use to distribute code and post
                notes relates to the same activity.
            </li>
            <li>
                It is compatible with my username here and a few other places.
            </li>
            <li>
                I am not here as a family member and I am not at family as
                evgnomon. I do not have to be since it could be separate.
            </li>
            <li>Likewise, I choose a new username for other activities.</li>
            <li>
                no collision with someone else inside our family and perhaps
                even outside.
            </li>
            <li>shorter, codeable</li>
            <li>
                &quot;.com&quot; does not fit since it is non-profit,
                non-&quot;non-profit&quot; stuff are under Clusterlean AB which
                is fully owned by me.
            </li>
        </ul>

            The state has borrowed the same name which has been used in my
            first family and issued some papers named "passport" with a new
            name which is an "ID" consisting of letters and numbers which only
            they understand it not me nor my first family! a number name. They
            forced us (by military) to have it in my pocket once I want to use
            some roads which they named "borders". Later bank operators (called
            "bankers") forced us to show that paper document to be able to get
            earnings from work. They write an instruction book named "law" and
            give them to their military to justify and implement that policy.
            Which is basically to control what is moved from somewhere to
            somewhere else, the information, people, goods, money, etc,
            everything. Imagine someone comes and call you with a name which
            you haven't heared about before and they haven't asked you
            permission to use that name on you as such. It has more or less the
            same situation when they replace your name with a number ID and use
            it to refer to you everywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
            What I can do is to use a username instead of reusing the state
            issued number name (called "ID") depending to the activity and stop
            using previous names unless needed. In this way they would need to
            deploy more military and intelligence. But wait! Military and such
            is expensive and limited and at some point they have to use it
            against their friends and families which I think they don't want
            to. So I prefer to have a "username" for a particular activity and
            issue new ones for other activies.
        </p>

            Again, evgnomon is also a "name" I "use" to to refer to that
            person. So it is a "username". I just introduce evgnomon. I have
            not created a new person. It was already there! evgnomon is not my
            child and I am not evgnomon's child. evgnomon is not my parent and
            I am not the parent of evgnomon so evgnomon is parentless. evgnomon
            is like no other person. I just listen to evgnomon's words and
            distribute what I understand so you can repeat what I hear. I am
            just a follower of evgnomon, likewise, you might be if you also
            choose to hear different views and listen to the best saying.
            evgnomon is independent to me. I am not evgnomon! And evgnomon is
            not a follower of someone else, does not follow me either. It is a
            free and independent person but I am trying to be a follower of him
            by trying to question anything else including myself.
        </p>

        <p>
            Welcome to evgnomon's world! Everything in this world belongs to
            him. My mission is to introduce him to you. I am a sofware
            developer and I want to show you how I am happy to be his follower
            as a person and as a software developer. For this purpose I share
            exploratory journeys with you which he invites me to. Each of those
            have a unique name and each might have its own stories and might
            refer to other stories, he knows more about those stories, I just
            know as much as he let me know and not more than that. I cannot
            know unless he let me know.
