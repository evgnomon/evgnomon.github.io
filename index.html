    <p>
      &quot;evgnomon&quot; is ευγνώμων in greek and pronounced ev̱gnó̱mo̱n means
      &quot;grateful&quot; which is also one of the meaning of &quot;Hamed&quot;
      in persian (فارسی)
    </p>
    <p>
      I choosed &quot;evgnomon.org&quot; over &quot;hamedghasemzadeh.com or
      such&quot; since
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        my name is &quot;Hamed Ghasemzadeh&quot; not
        &quot;hamedghasemzadeh&quot;
      </li>
      <li>I am not here as a family member and I am not at family as evgnomon</li>
      <li>no collision with someone else (inside or outside our family)</li>
      <li>brandable i.e. shorter, codeable and easier pronunciation</li>
      <li>
        &quot;.com&quot; does not fit since it is non-profit,
        non-&quot;non-profit&quot; stuff are under Clusterlean AB which is fully
        owned by me
      </li>
      <li>It is compatible with my username here and a few other places</li>
    </ul>
