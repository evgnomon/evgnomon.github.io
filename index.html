            <p>
                My ideology is I am not bound to any ideology except one. You
                heard except nothing than that ideology! I don't see any other
                ideology unless that works for me. We become one over question
                not over answer except one which we don't need and or want to
                question. So I don't see that I need you unless you need me and
                I don’t see that you need me unless I need you. You don't fall
                in unless to the point where you stand on. There we don't look
                back unless we see who survives.

                I am called "Hamed" by my parents and the family and it is also
                my passport name. &quot;<i>evgnomon</i>&quot; is ευγνώμων in
                greek and pronounced ev̱gnó̱mo̱n means &quot;grateful&quot; which
                is also what &quot;Hamed&quot; means in persian (فارسی).
            </p>
            <p>
                I choosed &quot;<i>evgnomon</i>.org&quot; over
                &quot;hamedghasemzadeh.com or such&quot; since
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    My name is not &quot;hamedghasemzadeh&quot;. It has space
                    in between.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It is compatible with my username here and a few other
                    places.
                </li>
                <li>
                    No collision with someone else inside our family and
                    perhaps even outside.
                </li>
                <li>shorter, codeable</li>
                <li>&quot;.com&quot; does not fit since it is non-profit.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                As I choose the name on <i>evgnomon</i> so first authorized to
                talk as evgnomon! like a messenger! You hear from me but also
                from evgnomon! as I hear it too!
