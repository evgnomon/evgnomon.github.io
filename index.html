    <p>
      &quot;evgnomon&quot; is ευγνώμων in greek and pronounced ev̱gnó̱mo̱n means
      &quot;grateful&quot; which is also one of the meaning of &quot;Hamed&quot;
      in persian (فارسی). I was called "Hamed" by my parents. The community
      which we as a family were living has picked up the name "Ghasemzadeh"
      to refer to us as a family.

    <p>
      I choosed &quot;evgnomon.org&quot; over &quot;hamedghasemzadeh.com or
      such&quot; since

    <ul>
      <li>
         &quot;Hamed Ghasemzadeh&quot; not
        &quot;hamedghasemzadeh&quot;
      </li>
      <li>evgnomon is my username which I use to distribute code and post
          notes relates to the same activity</li>
      <li>It is compatible with my username here and a few other places</li>
      <li>I choose other usernames for other activities</li>
      <li>I am not here as a family member and I am not at family as evgnomon</li>
      <li>no collision with someone else our family and perhaps even outside</li>
      <li>shorter, codeable and easier pronunciation, so universal</li>
      <li>
        &quot;.com&quot; does not fit since it is non-profit,
        non-&quot;non-profit&quot; stuff are under Clusterlean AB which is fully
        owned by me
      </li>
