      &quot;evgnomon&quot; is ευγνώμων in greek and pronounced ev̱gnó̱mo̱n means
      &quot;grateful&quot; which is also one of the meaning of &quot;Hamed&quot;
      in persian (فارسی). I was called "Hamed" by my parents. The community
      which we as a family were living has picked up the name "Ghasemzadeh"
      to refer to us as a family.
    </p>
    <p>
      I choosed &quot;evgnomon.org&quot; over &quot;hamedghasemzadeh.com or
      such&quot; since
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
         &quot;Hamed Ghasemzadeh&quot; not
        &quot;hamedghasemzadeh&quot;. And I can not have space in between.
      </li>
      <li>evgnomon is my username which I use to distribute code and post
          notes relates to the same activity.</li>
      <li>It is compatible with my username here and a few other places.</li>
      <li>I am not here as a family member and I am not at family as evgnomon.
      I do not have to be since it could be separate.</li>
      <li>Likewise, I choose a new username for other activities.</li>
      <li>no collision with someone else inside our family and perhaps even
          outside.</li>
      <li>shorter, codeable and easier pronunciation.</li>
      <li>
        &quot;.com&quot; does not fit since it is non-profit,
        non-&quot;non-profit&quot; stuff are under Clusterlean AB which is fully
        owned by me.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    The state has borrowed the same name which has been used in my first family
    and issued some papers named "passport" with a new name which is an ID
    consisting of letters and numbers which only they understand it not me nor
    my first family! a number name. They forced me (by military) to have it in
    my pocket once I want to use some roads which they named "borders". Later
    bank operators ("bankers") forced me to show that paper document to be able
    to get earnings from work. The state has forced me to pay Tax for all those
    military activies and some others things which is classified and they do
    not talk about it!  The tax office has attached my home address to that
    number ID and published it as "public domain"! the mobile operator has
    forced me to show that number ID (they named "passport") to be able to send
    a text message to my friends and families where those borrowed my name and
    forced me wrote it on their papers. So the phone number is effectively same
    as that number ID.  I was asked to provide those numeric ID to give
    "evgnomon.org" to you!  And the IP address has geo location which
    effectively gets linked to that numeric ID and could be precisely mapped to
    that number ID without them come and ask permission from me. They say the
    majority has voted for these inconveniences which they call "policy". They
    write an instruction book named "law" and give them to their military to
    implement that policy. Which is basically to control what is moved
    from somewhere to somewhere else, the information, people, goods, money,
    etc.
    </p>
    <p>
    What I can do to stop them control me is to issue a new ID depending to the
    activity and stop using previous names unless needed. In this way they
    would need to deploy more military and intelligence. But wait! Military is
    limited and at some point they have to use it against their friends and
    families which they can not since that means they are using it against
    themselves. So military is limited but issuing names and giving meaning to
    it is unlimited.
