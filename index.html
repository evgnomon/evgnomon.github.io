                &quot;<i>evgnomon</i>&quot; is ευγνώμων in greek and pronounced
                ev̱gnó̱mo̱n means &quot;grateful&quot; which is also one of the
                meaning of &quot;Hamed&quot; in persian (فارسی). I was called
                "Hamed" by my parents. My family community has picked up the
                name "Ghasemzadeh" to refer to us as a family.
            </p>
            <p>
                I choosed &quot;<i>evgnomon</i>.org&quot; over
                &quot;hamedghasemzadeh.com or such&quot; since
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    &quot;Hamed Ghasemzadeh&quot; not
                    &quot;hamedghasemzadeh&quot;.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>evgnomon</i> is my username which I use to distribute
                    code and post notes related to the same work.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It is compatible with my username here and a few other
                    places.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I am not here as a family member and I am not at family as
                    <i>evgnomon</i>. I do not have to be since it could be
                    separate. Likewise, I choose a new username for other
                    activities.
                </li>
                <li>
                    No collision with someone else inside our family and
                    perhaps even outside.
                </li>

                <li>
                    &quot;.com&quot; does not fit since it is non-profit,
                    non-&quot;non-profit&quot; stuff are under Clusterlean AB
                    which is fully owned by me.

                The state has borrowed my family name which has been used in my
                first family and issued some papers named "passport" with a new
                name which is an "ID" consisting of letters and numbers which
                only they understand it not me nor my first family! a number
                name. They (can) force us to have it in pocket once passing
                roads which they (re)named to "borders". Later bank operators
                (called "bankers") forced us to show that paper document to be
                able to get earnings from work. They write an instruction book
                named "law" and give them to their military to justify and
                implement that policy. Which is basically to control what is
                moved from somewhere to somewhere else, the information,
                people, goods, money, etc, everything. Imagine someone comes
                and call you with a name which you haven't heared about before
                and they haven't asked you permission to use that name on you
                as such and they are ready to use force! It has more or less
                the same situation when they replace your name with a number ID
                and use it to refer to you everywhere.
            </p>
            <p>
                What I can do is to use a username instead of using the state
                issued number name (called "ID") depending to the activity and
                stop using previous names over and over. Then I am not
                "evgnomon" but a messenger which let you know what I hear from
                <i>evgnomon</i>. Again, <i>evgnomon</i> is nameless, I have
                used this name on that identity. I use this name to refer to
                that I dentity which I want to talk in the name of that, It is
                a "username" so. And, I am the last one forever which speaks in
                the name of <i>evgnomon</i>. I am just somebody like you, but
                authorized to talk as <i>evgnomon</i>.
            </p>
            <p>Welcome to <i>evgnomon</i>'s world!, You heard this from me.</p>
