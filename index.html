                I am not bound to any ideology except one! Did you hear it? Maybe, I hope so.
                All questions must have answer so! With one exception right?
                I don't see any other ideology unless that works for me. Would you need to?
                I don't need you if you don't work for me! Should I?
                Ah! OK, But! Should I need you if you don't need me?
                You have no standpoint except one! Do you see it?
                Time ticks forever! With an exception right?

           This is what ChatGPT understood on the above passage:
"Overall, the passage seems to advocate for a philosophy that places high value on individual perspective, personal benefit, and a somewhat skeptical view of mutual or altruistic relationships. It challenges the reader to reflect on these viewpoints, possibly questioning their own beliefs and relationships in the process." Do you agree?

                I am called "Hamed" by my parents and the family and it is also
                my passport name. &quot;<i>evgnomon</i>&quot; is ευγνώμων in
                greek and pronounced ev̱gnó̱mo̱n means &quot;grateful&quot; which
                is also what &quot;Hamed&quot; means in persian (فارسی).
            </p>
            <p>
                I choosed &quot;<i>evgnomon</i>.org&quot; over
                &quot;hamedghasemzadeh.com or such&quot; since
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    My name is not &quot;hamedghasemzadeh&quot;. It has space
                    in between.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It is compatible with my username here and a few other
                    places.
                </li>
                <li>
                    No collision with someone else inside our family and
                    perhaps even outside.
                </li>
                <li>shorter, codeable</li>
                <li>&quot;.com&quot; does not fit since it is non-profit.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                As I choose the name on <i>evgnomon</i> so first authorized to
                talk as evgnomon! like a messenger! You hear from me but also
                from evgnomon! as I hear it too!
